# Physics-Simulation-Gaussian-
Project made for research assistant program at Michigan State University
#Functionality
 - Program consists of a simulation of balls along string 
 - User inputs # of balls, seperation between balls, and length of simulation
 - The program assigns a random velocity to each ball based on a gaussian distrubution 
 - The simulation outputs the velocity and position of the balls every 1 second 
 - These values are updated based on elastic collisions (no loss of energy) between the balls <br />
